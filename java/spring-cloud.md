# Spring Cloud : Exploring Spring Cloud Implementation

Spencer Gibb

> What is Spring Cloud? What types of problems does it solve? What can you choose to solve those problems? In this session we will discuss the Spring Cloud abstractions and interfaces that may be implemented: DiscoveryClient, LoadBalancerClient, Configuration, Bus and Tracing. We will compare and contrast some target technologies and discus the tradeoffs and nuances of each, such as: netflix, consul, etcd, zookeeper and zipkin. Join Spring Cloud co-lead Spencer Gibb for discussion and demonstration of Spring Cloud implementations of these technologies.
